--- COMPILATION ---

Compile with release flags:
    
    "make" or "make release"

Compile with debug flags:

    "make debug"

--- RUNNING WITH MAKE ---

Run release version:

    "make run ARGS="arg1 arg2 ..."

Run release version and clean (silently):

    "make crun ARGS="arg1 arg2 ..."

--- OTHER MAKEFILE TARGETS ---

Clean generated files:

    "make clean"

Create archive without repository items:

    "make archive"

--- ARGUMENT EXAMPLES ---
IMPORTANT:

    using argument --ideal-yield=KG_PER_ARE can produce results which are not in line with the documentation
    use for experiments

note: assuming directory <Makefile root dir>/bin -- cd bin
warning: all arguments are case SENSITIVE!

Get help:

    ./cornsim -h

Skip every action and use default values (use -h to see default values):

    ./cornsim

Print extra information:

    ./cornsim -v

Do every possible action:

    ./cornsim -a

Various combinations:

    ./cornsim -va 
    ./cornsim -av

    # ideal
    ./cornsim -a --soil-ph=6.0

    # --water is redundant
    ./cornsim -a --water

    ./cornsim --water --fertilize
